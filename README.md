# AirTwin AI

**Agentic Digital Twin Platform for Post-Discharge Respiratory Recovery**

AirTwin AI is a clean, medical-focused web dashboard demo designed to support post-discharge respiratory recovery monitoring. The project simulates two main user experiences: a **Patient Portal** for daily recovery tracking and a **Doctor Dashboard** for monitoring patient status, AI alerts, and recovery reports.

This is currently a **frontend demo** built with React, using static mock data to demonstrate the product concept, UI flow, and core dashboard features.

## Overview

Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, COPD, asthma, bronchitis, and post-COVID complications often require continued monitoring after hospital discharge. However, hospitals and doctors may not be able to track every patient’s daily recovery status in real time.

AirTwin AI aims to reduce this gap by providing a digital recovery dashboard where:

* Patients can track symptoms, complete daily tasks, submit cough recordings, and review recovery progress.
* Doctors can monitor patient risk levels, review AI-generated alerts, and access patient recovery reports.
* AI-assisted explanations help make recovery status more understandable and actionable.

The current version focuses on frontend interface design, route structure, component architecture, and static dashboard simulation.
